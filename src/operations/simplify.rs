/// This function removes points that are less than the specified epsilon
/// distance from an imaginary line that passes through its 2 adjacent points.
/// Logically, smaller epsilon values will be less aggressive in removing
/// points than larger epsilon values.
///
/// This function is strongly recommended following offsetting
/// (ie inflating/shrinking), especially when offsetting paths multiple times.
/// Offsetting often creates tiny segments that don't improve path quality.
/// Further these tiny segments can be at angles that have been affected by
/// integer rounding. While these tiny segments are too small to be noticeable
/// following a single offset procedure, they can degrade both the shape quality
/// and the performance of subsequent offsets.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use clipper2::*;
///
/// let path: Path = vec![(1.0, 2.0), (1.0, 2.5), (1.2, 4.0), (1.8, 6.0)].into();
/// let path_simplified = simplify(path.translate(3.0, 0.0), 0.5, false);
///
/// dbg!(path, path_simplified);
/// ```
